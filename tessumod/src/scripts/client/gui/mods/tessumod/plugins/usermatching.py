							Useful for testing different extract patterns and name mappings.
							Use as follows:
							 1. Start one of your replays (from game's replays-folder)
							 2. Connect to TeamSpeak
							 3. Change your TS nickname to form you wish to test
							 4. Change this option to 'off'
							 5. Try talking and see if the speak notifications appear in-game.

							For more info, see: https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html
							The captured nickname is also stripped of any surrounding white space and

							You can also define multiple patterns separated with commas (,). First
