"""
This module listens for game events and notifies listeners when players are
added, or removed from prebattle (like platoon, training room, team battle
room, etc...).

Emits following events through given "events" object:
 - prebattle_player_added:   when player joins the prebattle
 - prebattle_player_removed: when player leaves the prebattle

Each event has a dict argument which has following keys and values:
 - id:   player's ID (int)
 - name: player's name (str)
